# Pizza-Sales-Optimization-Dashboard_SM

The Pizza Sales Optimization Dashboard is a cohesive data-driven tool designed to provide a clear and real-time overview of OverDrive pizza restaurant's sales performance and key metrics. This interactive dashboard offers crucial insights into the restaurant's sales allowing key stakeholders to increase revenue and enhance customer satisfaction by optimizing sales, operations, and inventory. The dashboard saves time by quickly breaking down sales and can be easily automated for real-time data insights.

## Objective
The primary objective is to provide stakeholders with a comprehensive overview of the sales performance. Visualizing the sales data through a dashboard enhances decision-making and strategic planning by giving crucial insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises pizza sales data with order details like date, total price, customer information, and pizza categories. Other dependencies include pizza ingredients, pizza size, and pizza type. The dataset was initially part of a sales tracker in the restaurant's database updated daily. Then the dataset was imported to SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to calculate KPIs, and the database server was then connected to Power BI to clean and transform. The structural procedure was automated with a daily recurring job task, allowing to integrate into a fully functional automated real-time dashboard. 

## Features
  - Interactive Visualizations: The dashboard offers interactive visualizations such as line charts, bar charts, and pie charts, allowing users of all backgrounds to explore sales data.

  - Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Important metrics such as total revenue, average order value, total pizzas sold, and total orders are highlighted for easy monitoring.

  - Filtering and Drill-Down: Users can filter data by date, pizza type, pizza size, pizza name, and pizza price to drill down into specific insights.

  - Data Cleaning and Transformation: Raw data from the Sales Tracker was transformed using SQL Server Management Studio, Power BI, and DAX formula ensuring data integrity and consistency before integration.

  - Best Selling: The dashboard highlights best-selling pizzas based on revenue, quantity sold, and total orders, providing insights into the most popular pizza items.

  - Automated Real-time Insights: The dashboard is automated by creating a recurring job task in SSMS and importing the real-time data source from the SQL Server Database to Power BI.
